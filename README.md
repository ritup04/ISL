# Indian Sign Language Recognition – Deep Learning Models

## 📊 Overview

This project uses deep learning models to classify **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** gestures into their corresponding labels. The objective is to recognize ISL gestures using two powerful models: **ResNet50** and **MobileNetV2**. The project leverages **transfer learning**, using pre-trained models to reduce training time and improve classification accuracy.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `requirements.txt` – List of required Python dependencies (if any)
  
## 🧩 Objectives

- Build a deep learning model for recognizing ISL gestures.
- Use pre-trained models like **ResNet50** and **MobileNetV2** for transfer learning.
- Evaluate the models based on accuracy, both on training and testing datasets.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models (ResNet50 and MobileNetV2) to enhance classification performance with fewer training data.
- **Data Augmentation**: Augments the training data with rotations, shifts, zooms, and flips to make the model more robust.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the models on both training and test datasets, reporting accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the training and validation accuracy curves for both models.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **ResNet50** achieved **88.65%** accuracy on the test set.
- **MobileNetV2** achieved **87.23%** accuracy on the test set.
- Both models performed well, with training accuracies above **98%**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow 2.x**
- **Keras**
- **OpenCV**

## 📂 Datasets Used

- [Indian Sign Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumyakushwaha/indian-sign-language-dataset): A collection of images of ISL gestures, categorized by letters, numbers, and other common gestures.

> *Note: The dataset is preprocessed for resizing images, encoding labels, and applying augmentation techniques.*

## 🔄 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn kagglehub
   ```
3. Run the `indian_sign_language_recognition.py` script to train the models.
4. The models will be trained on the dataset and display evaluation results, including training and test accuracy.
5. Use the plots generated by `matplotlib` to visualize model performance.

## 📌 Model Details

### ResNet50
- **ResNet50** is a deep residual network that uses skip connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. This architecture is well-suited for image classification tasks as it can capture hierarchical features effectively.
- **Pre-trained on ImageNet**, the model is fine-tuned on the ISL dataset to classify gestures.
- **Fine-tuning** was performed starting from layer 80 (pre-trained layers frozen).

### MobileNetV2
- **MobileNetV2** is an efficient convolutional neural network architecture designed for mobile and edge devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computation while maintaining accuracy.
- The model is pre-trained on **ImageNet** and fine-tuned on the ISL dataset for gesture classification.
- **Fine-tuning** was done from layer 50 to allow the model to adapt to the new dataset.

## 📌 Use Cases

- **Sign Language Interpreters**: Automate interpretation of sign language in real-time applications.
- **Educational Institutions**: Develop learning tools for students to learn sign language.
- **Tech Companies**: Integrate gesture recognition in apps and systems for accessibility.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Experiment with other models like **VGG16** or **InceptionV3** to compare performance.
- Implement a real-time sign language recognition system using a webcam.
- Integrate the model into a mobile or web app for broader accessibility.
